# Power BI – Classic Models Business Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is a business intelligence dashboard built using Power BI on the Classic Models dataset.
The objective of the analysis is to evaluate sales performance, product demand, customer contribution,
and time-based trends to support data-driven business decisions.

The report is designed with an executive summary view, followed by detailed analytical pages
for product, customer, and trend analysis.

It includes structured relational data covering customers, orders, products, employees, and payments.

Key tables used:
- Orders and Order Details
- Products and Product Lines

- Employees

Data preparation and transformations were performed using Power Query.
